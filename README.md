# srun

A heavily wip program that will evolve as it is developed

Acts as a sort of script/alias manager with a convenient command-line interface.

The primary motivation for this is to better manage my growing alias file where
I keep multiple heavily related aliases with the same prefix, as well as to
become a convenient place to store cool one-liners I may use once in a blue
moon.
